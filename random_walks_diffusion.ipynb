    "<h2> Visualization of diffusion: Random walks </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In one model of molecular motion (which applies in the case of an ideal gas), individual molecules are hard spheres that fly around through space constantly bouncing off of each other. Because of the large scale of this, the effect for a single molecule is to take a *random walk*. We can conceptualize this as a small step in a random direction, then a random change of angle and another step. The distance that a molecule travels before a collection follows a probability distribution whose mean is called the [mean free path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path). For air at ambient temperature and pressure, the mean free path is about $65$ nanometers and gets traversed in a time on the order of $100$ picoseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple model of this, let's restrict to the four cardinal directions. A particle will choose a direction to travel with equal probabilities and step one unit in that direction. It will then re-choose a direction and continue the step. The following code implements that and graphs the trajectory of a single particle starting at the origin:"
